Welcome to this boilerplate

See .env where to create your api and mysql db

To install everything, do the following:

- On the server, clone repo into /home/.../...
- Create db on the server with `CREATE DATABASE mydatabase CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;`
- to put the api online, `git pull`, `yarn`, `yarn build`, `yarn serve` (or `yarn cluster`)
